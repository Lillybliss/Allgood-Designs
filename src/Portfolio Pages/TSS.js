          Over the course of my final year at UCF, I collaborated closely with a
          team of four fellow students on an extensive project dedicated to
          crafting 'The Suite Spot,' a salon suites website. â€œThe Suite Spot" is
          a salon suites website designed to empower users by providing
          information about the company, facilitating appointment bookings with
          service providers, enabling interaction with the online shop, and
          managing orders/appointments through user accounts.
        </p>
        <p className="port-about-text">
          Our collaborative efforts involved comprehensive user research, UI
          design, and responsive development for the platform. Here, I will
          break down each phase of our project: the design phase, development
          phase, and deployment phase. My primary contributions involve shaping
          the design guide, designing prototypes, developing the user account
          system in React.js, and interacting with the database through MongoDB.

          effort not only elevated the quality of our deliverables but also
          cultivated a positive working atmosphere.
